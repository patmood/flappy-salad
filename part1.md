## Scenes
Game scenes are used to organize your project into separate parts. You might have a menu scene, a game screen, or a separate screen for each level. In this game we can use 1 scene.

## Actors
Actors are objects in your game that contain unique behavior. This makes it easy to reuse the same work over and over again so we dont repeat ourselves. An actor could be the player, an enemy, an obstacle, or even just a background.
